# Help document for `\src`

This document along with comments in this repo is written while I'm reviewing the repo. Mistakes may have been made.

Comments start with a '?' mean that I'm not sure if my understanding is correct.

## `> controller`

### `>> drivers`

#### `>>> dynamixel`

Files here are for steers from *Dynamixel*.

#### `>>> gpio`

### `>> options`

Files here realize **program_options**. For example, in `./a.out -help`, `-help` is a **program_option**.
